# CmdLine File Browser
A sample app demonstrating how an app that is activated from a command-line can now access the file-system. The user can open a command prompt, and navigate to any arbitrary file-system location. The app declares an AppExecutionAlias, which allows the user to execute the app from a command prompt. The app will have permissions to the file-system from the point to which the user navigated, and downwards. The app displays a tree view of the file-system from the given starting point.
